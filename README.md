## Project Description

This is an implementation of a GUI application in Java using JavaFX 11 that displays a 
gallery of images based on the results of a search query to the 
[iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/#searching).
I utilized and accessed the API by using a combination of JSON and JavaScript.
This project helped me learn about concepts such as inheritance, threads, polymorphism, and interfaces.
